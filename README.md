### Rules:

Just a simple game of blackjack against Jigsaw.

You start with $1000.  Play against Jigsaw as you try to become rich.  

   The rules are like a normal game of Blackjack, except Jigsaw doesn't believe in insurance or splitting pairs. The goal of Jigsaw Blackjack is to for your hand value be worth more than Jigsaw's without going over 21.
    The numerical cards are worth the number on their card.  Face cards are worth 10 and Aces are worth 1 or 11.
    Place your bet then you and Jigsaw are dealt two cards, where one of Jigsaw's cards is facedown.  After your hand is dealt, you have the option to hit, stay, or double down (see more information below).  After finishing your actions, it is Jigsaw's turn.  Jigsaw must continue drawing cards until his hand value is 17 or more, unless he has a soft 17.  A soft 17 is when Jigsaw's hand value is 17, Jigsaw has an ace in his hand, and is able to hit without going over 21.  If both your hand and Jigsaw's hand values are 21 or less,
    then whoever has the higher hand value wins.  Beware: If your hand value exceeds 21, you lose.  If Jigsaw's
    hand exceeds 21, then you win.  Blackjack pays 3:2.
    Hit: You will receive another card and as long as your hand value is 21 or less, you may continue to hit
    Stay: You are content with your hand and would like to turn it over to Jigsaw.
    Double Down: You place a bet equal to the amount of your original bet and receive only one card.  It is then
    Jigsaw's turn.  If you win, you win both your original and double down bet.  If you lose, you lose both bets.
